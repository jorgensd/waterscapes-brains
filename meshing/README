## Requirements:

# meshio, fenics, SVMTK, FreeSurfer, numpy

## Notes:

# Script extract-ventricles.sh copied from mri2fem book
# (chp4/extract-ventricles.sh), updated location of input filename.

# The script mesh_checker.py was provided by JÃ¸rgen Dokken and Chris
# Richardson as a script for testing the validity of the resulting
# mesh, concretely whether the mesh is a pure simplicial complex.

## Instructions:

# To generate left hemisphere brain mesh (without ventricle(s)), with
# boundary markers, from scratch, run:
python3 create_mesh.py --generate_stl --preprocess_surfaces --create 12

# To generate full brain mesh, uncomment suitable line in the code and
# set wholebrain=True... and then do:

# To generate full brain mesh (without ventricles), with gray and
# white markers, from scratch, run:
python3 create_mesh.py --generate_stl --preprocess_surfaces --create 12

# To just create the mesh (after generating surfaces etc, run)
python3 create_mesh.py --create 12

# NB: The above command depends on FreeSurfer, meshio, SVMTK, but not
# on FEniCS, and will take perhaps 1-2 minutes to complete.

# Adjust other parameters in create_mesh functions to adjust
# smoothing, surface meshing parameters etc.

# Next

# Run fenics in a Docker container e.g. and there install meshio via
# pip. For instance, you can set up an environment via.

fenicsproject create mri2fem # First time only
fenicsproject start mri2fem
sudo pip3 install meshio # First time only
sudo pip3 install h5py   # First time only

# And then run the FEniCS processing of the mesh, here abby_16:
python3 create_mesh.py --postprocess 16

# Check mesh with Dokken's topology check script.
python3 mesh_checker.py --infile abby_lh_12

# To clean everything and start a new, do
python3 create_mesh.py --clean

# abby_4: 37179 cells, 7848 vertices. # Too coarse for anything but prototyping
# abby_6: 90367 cells, 17750 vertices.
# abby_7: 117045 cells, 23024 vertices.
# abby_8: 145195 cells, 28652 vertices.
